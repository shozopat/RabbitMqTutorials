direct exchange uses default exchange
binding key = routing key
example shopping cart events

Exchange:Shopping_events_exchange
Queues:
	Grocery queue:
		Binding Key : Groceries
	Electronics queue:
		Binding Key : electronies
Message1 :
	Routing Key : Groceries
Message2 :
	Routing Key : electronies
	
Topic Exchange:
Routing Pattern allows 
* - 1 word
# - 0 or more words
Topic Exchange:
	Routing pattern is allowed for binding key. 

India.Maharashtra.Thane
Country.state.district

queue1 - *.Maharastra.Thane
queue2 - India.#
queue3 - *.Rajasthan.*
queue4 - #.Pune


Fanout Exchange:
Messages are routed to all queues bounded to the exchange.
Routing and bounding keys if provided will be ignored.
when same message is to be send to different consumers who may perform different task with the msg.
Example salary is credited this msg will be send to :
icici bank - home loan taken
hdfc bank - car loan
kotak bank - personal loan


Header Exchange:
similar to Topic Exchange.
Routing is done based on header values instead of routing keys.
Message is considered matching if the value of header equals value specified during binding.
x-match - special argument which is added to binding between exchange and queue which tells
whether all values of header(k-v) pair needs to be match or any single will done
x-match - has 2 options any or all.
all - all header values must match.
any - any means atleast 1 header value should match.
headers can be constructed using wide variety of data integer or hash.

Example:

Message1:format=json;type=info;token=a1234
queue1: Binding : format=json;type=info;token=a1234;x-match=all

queue2: Binding : format=json;x-match=any

mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=org.codehaus.mojo.archetypes -DarchetypeArtifactId=pom-root -DarchetypeVersion=RELEASE

queueDeclare(java.lang.String queue, boolean passive, boolean durable, boolean exclusive, boolean autoDelete, java.util.Map<java.lang.String,java.lang.Object> arguments) 

in fanout exchange message publish to exchange is delivered to all the queues. but if there are multiple consumers attached then message will be delivered
in rr fashion to consumers and it will be recieved by all queues in respective consumers.
